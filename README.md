## 7 What bugs/incomplete features still need to be fixed or implemented?

- direct messages received show up as undefined and aren't saved to permanent state
- there's no feature to follow other users
- the ‘year since’ in the footer drop down menu doesn’t reflect on the DOM
- the link on the “Posted by {name}” is broken and returns the user to top of page
- default “Posts by user {drop down box}” does not appear but other users do when selected
- no confirmation that message was saved or sent to another user
- the star used to select favorites can be used clicked repeatedly on the same gif post, which generates multiple likes for a single post and there's not undo option to remove a favorite post from a users list.
